# LAB 2-3-(4 with challenge exercises)

##  Notes to future: 

    -  refactor the solution when `generics` are released and all libraries are migrated to use it. 
    -  there are probably some goroutine leaks, some unneccessary critical sections, don't even try to fix it 
    without some major changes to the language
    -  look into test suites more. Writing such extensive test looks much more challenging than implementing toy 
    kv server with the help of these tests. 
    -  change timeout mechanism. 
    

* to run the tests: (it takes half an hour) ./run.sh > results.txt
